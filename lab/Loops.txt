Printing out numbers!

Your will output a set of numbers from 0 - 100 based on a single digit input from the user.

Example:

Input: 7
Output: 7,17,27,37,47,57,67,77,87,97

Input: 0
Output: 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100

Input: 1
Output: 1,11,21,31,41,51,61,71,81,91


The user will only be allowed to enter a single digit input so you can assume all other input are invalid.
